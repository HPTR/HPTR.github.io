        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <p>I am currently learning to code with Codecademy and as part of the Full Stack Career Path, they recommend setting up a GitHub Pages page to showcase all the projects you complete throughout the path. This page will understandably be a constant work in progress as I learn and become more adept at using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below I intend to provide links to my various projects, all of which will be hosted on GitHub.</p>
        <h2>Mixed Messages</h2>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://hptr.github.io/mixed-messages/">Project Page</a>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HPTR/mixed-messages">GitHub Page</a>
        <p>Mixed Messages is the first major project that I completed using Git and GitHub. The brief of the project was that I should create a program that generates random messages on a topic of my choosing by using at least 3 different variables. I chose video game reviews as my topic and used 4 variables. While not specified in the brief, I decided to attach the function to an HTML page, and applied some simple CSS to showcase the output of the program. I feel the project went pretty well overall and felt confident in my ability to complete any upcoming simple projects like this.</p>
