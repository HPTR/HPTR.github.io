        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <p>I am currently learning to code with Codecademy and as part of the Full Stack Career Path, they recommend setting up a GitHub Pages page to showcase all the projects you complete throughout the path. This page will understandably be a constant work in progress as I learn and become more adept at using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below I intend to provide links to my various projects, all of which will be hosted on GitHub.</p>
        <h2>Mixed Messages</h2>
        <div class="linkContainer">
            <div class="leftLink"  id="mm">
                <a class="projectLink" target="_blank" href="https://hptr.github.io/mixed-messages/">Project Page</a>
            </div>
            <div class="rightLink">
                <a class="githubLink" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HPTR/mixed-messages">GitHub Page</a>
            </div>

        <p> 
            Mixed Messages is the first major project that I completed using Git and GitHub.
            The brief of the project was that I should create a program that generates random messages on a topic of my choosing by using at least 3 different variables.
            I chose video game reviews as my topic and used 4 variables.
            While not specified in the brief, I decided to attach the function to an HTML page, and applied some simple CSS to showcase the output of the program.
            I feel the project went pretty well overall and felt confident in my ability to complete any upcoming simple projects like this.

        <h2>Website Style Page</h2>
        <div class="linkContainer">
            <div class="leftLink"  id="WDS">
                <a class="projectLink" target="_blank" href="https://hptr.github.io/WebsiteDesignSystem/">Project Page</a>
            </div>
            <div class="rightLink">
                <a class="githubLink" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HPTR/WebsiteDesignSystem">GitHub Page</a>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p> 
            The next project I completed was an exercise designed to test the user's abilities in HTML and CSS, and had the user create a style page for a non-existant website. The user was instructed to use whatever colors/fonts they desired to create the page.

        <h3>Latest Addition to the Site</h3>
        <p> 
            The latest feature I've added is the  pair of links to the Mixed Messages project and corresponding GitHub page.
            I made a lot of mistakes along the way, having to redesign my method 3+ times, however I feel it has turned out quite well considering!
        </p>
        <h3>Planned Additions to the Site</h3>
        <p>
            Next I want to add a new project to the site, using the same CSS rules to style the Mixed Messages links.
