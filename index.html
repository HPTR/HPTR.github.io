        <p>I am currently learning to code with Codecademy and as part of the Full Stack Career Path, they recommend setting up a GitHub Pages page to showcase all the projects you complete throughout the path. This page will understandably be a constant work in progress as I learn and become more adept at using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below I intend to provide links to my various projects, all of which will be hosted on GitHub.</p>

            Mixed Messages is the first major project that I completed using Git and GitHub.
            The brief of the project was that I should create a program that generates random messages on a topic of my choosing by using at least 3 different variables.
            I chose video game reviews as my topic and used 4 variables.
            While not specified in the brief, I decided to attach the function to an HTML page, and applied some simple CSS to showcase the output of the program.
            I feel the project went pretty well overall and felt confident in my ability to complete any upcoming simple projects like this.

        <h2>Website Style Page</h2>
        <div class="linkContainer">
            <div class="leftLink"  id="WDS">
                <a class="projectLink" target="_blank" href="https://hptr.github.io/WebsiteDesignSystem/">Project Page</a>

            The next project I completed was an exercise designed to test the user's abilities in HTML and CSS, and had the user create a style page for a non-existant website. The user was instructed to use whatever colors/fonts they desired to create the page.

        <h3>Latest Addition to the Site</h3>
        <p> 
            The latest feature I've added is the pair of links to the Website Style Page project and corresponding GitHub page.
            I made a lot of mistakes along the way, having to redesign my method 3+ times, however I feel it has turned out quite well considering!
            A new mistake I've realised since this newest addition is that my styling from the first two links didn't allow for future links to have different images, so I'll need to fix that at some point too!
        </p>
        <h3>Planned Additions to the Site</h3>
        <p>
            Next I want to fix the CSS of the page to allow for each project's page link to be styled individually naturally, as currently my solution isn't ideal.
