            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently learning to code with Codecademy and as part of the Full Stack Career Path, they recommend setting up a GitHub Pages page to showcase all the projects you complete throughout the path. This page will understandably be a constant work in progress as I learn and become more adept at using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below I intend to provide links to my various projects, all of which will be hosted on GitHub.</p>

            Mixed Messages is the first major project that I completed using Git and GitHub.
            The brief of the project was that I should create a program that generates random messages on a topic of my choosing by using at least 3 different variables.
            I chose video game reviews as my topic and used 4 variables.
            While not specified in the brief, I decided to attach the function to an HTML page, and applied some simple CSS to showcase the output of the program.
            I feel the project went pretty well overall and felt confident in my ability to complete any upcoming simple projects like this.

            The next project I completed was an exercise designed to test the user's abilities in HTML and CSS, and had the user create a style page for a non-existant website. The user was instructed to use whatever colors/fonts they desired to create the page.
